Architecture
============


A high-level overview of how jj-vfs is intended to work.

There are three primary pieces of software.

* JJ CLI w/ jj-vfs backend
* Daemon
* Remote Backend


1. CLI

The CLI is the primary way an end-user interacts with `jj-vfs`. It communicates with the `daemon` over gRPC. The CLI stores no persistent data. It can be used to initiate new jj-vfs repositories by requesting the daemon to mount the repo.

```bash
jj vfs init bwb@thelastyak.com/repo # initialize a local copy of a repo as bwb
```

2. Daemon

Runs on the end user machine. It is intended to be a long-lived process that is capable of being restarted.
It implements a control interface over gRPC which communicates with the JJ CLI (backend and working copy interfaces). It implements an NFS server and manages the local mounting of repos via an NFS client implementation. It caches reads and writes that interact with the backend.

```bash
jj vfs ls # List locally mounted repos
```

3. Backend

Stores all commit and repo data for all users


#### Timeline
1. Implement simple gRPC interface daemon <-> cli âœ”
2. Store commit and repos in remote backend, no optimization.
3. Store working copy in backend.
